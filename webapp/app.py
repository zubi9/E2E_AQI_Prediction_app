### About the Air Quality Levels

| AQI Range  | Air Pollution Level               | Health Implications                                      | Cautionary Statement (for PM2.5) |
|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 0 - 50    | **Good**                         | Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk. | None |
| 51 - 100  | **Moderate**                     | Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants, there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| 101 - 150 | **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| 151 - 200 | **Unhealthy**                     | Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| 201 - 300 | **Very Unhealthy**                | Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid all outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit outdoor exertion. |
| 300+      | **Hazardous**                     | Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects. | Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion. |
